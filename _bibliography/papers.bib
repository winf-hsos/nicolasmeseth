  abstract={In this paper, we evaluate the application of Bayesian Optimization (BO) to discrete event simulation (DES) models. In a first step, we create a simple model, for which we know the optimal set of parameter values in advance. We implement the model in SimPy, a framework for DES written in Python. We then interpret the simulation model as a black box function subject to optimization. We show that it is possible to find the optimal set of parameter values using the open source library GPyOpt. To enhance our evaluation, we create a second and more complex model. To better handle the complexity of the model, and to add a visual component, we build the second model in Simio, a commercial off-the-shelf simulation modeling tool. To apply BO to a model in Simio, we use the Simio API to write an extension for optimization plug-ins. This extension encapsulates the logic of the BO algorithm, which we deployed as a web service in the cloud. [..]},

  title={A survey on the use of simulation in German healthcare},
  author={Kirchhof, Patrick and Meseth, Nicolas},
  journal={Proceedings of the 2012 Winter Simulation Conference},
  year={2012},
  publisher={INFORMS-SIM},

  abstract={This paper reports on the results of a survey conducted among German healthcare institutions to collect data about the use of simulation in the respective field. The setup follows a survey published in Greasley (2008). One goal of the survey was to assess how many institutions have used simulation as a decision making tool before, and if they plan to do so in the future. Another focus are the potential reasons against the use of simulation, which are grouped into the categories costs, awareness, skills & experience, organizational-, and technical obstacles. The results indicate that while the use of simulation in German healthcare is low, costs are the main reason against a wider adoption. Following are lack of awareness among decision makers, and a lack of skills within the internal staff. An alleged negative reputation of simulation could not be confirmed.}
